## python-coaddx1d

This is a python translation of Charles Danforth's coaddx1d IDL
routine. This program provides the same capabilities as the IDL
coaddx1d routine. The coaddition provides three save file formats of
dat csv and a python pickle file (the equivalent of idl save files --
that is, the ability to save the python spectrum object). There are
also two convenient plotting routines for easy creation of plots of
the entire coadded spectrum.
